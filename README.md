# Multi-Sensor Home Security System with ESP32

## üéØ Project Vision

This project is an *open-source* initiative to transform a conventional house into a smart home by developing practical and useful automated modules. The goal is to create a system that is reliable, easily expandable, and adaptable to various home automation needs.

**Current Status:** `Functional Prototype`

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Comprehensive Hazard Detection:**
  - **Fire:** Rapid detection using an infrared sensor.
  - **LPG Gas:** Gas leak detection using an MQ-6 sensor.
  - **Smoke:** Smoke detection from potential fires using an MQ-2 sensor.
- **Smart Water Pump Control:**
  - **Two-Step Verification:** Prevents the pump from running dry by first checking for **water presence** in the pipe, then verifying the **water flow** after the pump starts.
  - **Flow Monitoring:** Measures and displays the water flow rate (Liters per Minute) while the pump is operating.
- **Intelligent Alert System:**
  - **Hazard Alarms:** Distinct alarm tones for each type of hazard (fire, gas, smoke).
  - **Pump Alarm:** A unique, intermittent alarm if the water tank requests water but the main supply is unavailable.
- **Professional Code Architecture:**
  - **Non-Blocking:** The entire system runs without disruptive `delay()` calls, ensuring high responsiveness.
  - **State Machines:** Efficiently and structurally manages the status of each module (alarms, pump).

### Step 2: Assembly and Wiring

#### A. Low-Voltage Connections (ESP32 to Modules)

Connect all sensors and modules to the ESP32 according to the following table. Pay attention to the `VIN` (for 5V) and `3V3` (for 3.3V) pins.

| Component | Component Pins | Connect to ESP32 Pins |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Flame Sensor** | `VCC`, `GND`, `DO` | `3V3`, `GND`, `GPIO 27` |
| **MQ-6 Gas Sensor (LPG)** | `VCC`, `GND`, `AO` | `VIN`, `GND`, `GPIO 34` |
| **MQ-2 Gas Sensor (Smoke)** | `VCC`, `GND`, `AO` | `VIN`, `GND`, `GPIO 35` |
| **Passive Speaker** | `+`, `-` | `GPIO 25`, `GND` |
| **AC Voltage Sensor** | `VCC`, `GND`, `Signal/OUT` | `3V3`, `GND`, `GPIO 32` |
| **Capacitive Level Sensor** | `VCC (Brown)`, `GND (Blue)`, `Signal (Black)` | `VIN`, `GND`, `GPIO 13` |
| **Water Flow Sensor** | `VCC (Red)`, `GND (Black)`, `Signal (Yellow)` | `VIN`, `GND`, `GPIO 12` |
| **Relay Module** | `VCC`, `GND`, `IN` | `VIN`, `GND`, `GPIO 26` |

#### B. High-Voltage Connections (AC 220V)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNING:** This section involves high-voltage electricity which is **EXTREMELY DANGEROUS**. Mistakes can lead to serious injury or death. If you are not 100% confident, **it is highly recommended to seek help from a professional electrician.** Ensure the main power source (MCB) to the pump is completely turned off before starting.

This system intercepts the signal from your mechanical float switch.

1.  **Identify Wires:**
    - **Live & Neutral Source Wires:** From your main power supply.
    - **Request Wire:** The Live wire coming *out* of your tank's float switch.

2.  **Connect the "Request Wire" to Two Places:**
    - **To the AC Voltage Sensor:** Connect the `Request Wire` to one AC input terminal on the sensor. Connect the `Neutral Source Wire` to the other AC input terminal. This tells the ESP32 that the tank is requesting water.
    - **To the Relay Module:** Branch the `Request Wire` and connect it to the **`COM` (Common)** terminal on the relay.

3.  **Connect the Relay to the Pump:**
    - Connect the **`NO` (Normally Open)** terminal on the relay to the **Live** terminal of the Water Pump.

4.  **Connect the Pump's Neutral:**
    - Connect the `Neutral Source Wire` directly to the **Neutral** terminal of the Water Pump.

### Step 3: Telegram Bot Setup (for Notifications)

To receive real-time notifications on your phone, you need to create a Telegram Bot.

1.  **Create a New Bot:**
    - In the Telegram app, search for `BotFather` (it has a blue checkmark).
    - Start a chat and type `/newbot`.
    - Follow the instructions to give your bot a name (e.g., "Smart Home Alarm") and a username (which must end in `bot`, e.g., `MySmartHomeAlertBot`).
    - **BotFather** will give you a secret **API Token**. Copy and save this token carefully.

2.  **Get Your Chat ID:**
    - **For Personal Notifications:** Search for the `userinfobot`, start a chat, and it will immediately give you your numeric **Chat ID**.
    - **For Group Notifications:**
        1. Create a new Telegram group.
        2. Add the bot you just created as a member of the group.
        3. Add `userinfobot` to the group.
        4. Type `/my_id` in the group. `userinfobot` will reply with the group's **Chat ID**. It will be a negative number (e.g., `-1001234567890`).

3.  **Update the Code:**
    - Open the `src/main.cpp` file.
    - Find the `WiFi & Telegram Configuration` section.
    - Replace the placeholder values for `WIFI_SSID`, `WIFI_PASSWORD`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` with your actual credentials.

### Step 4: Software Setup

1.  **Installation:**
    - Install **Visual Studio Code**.
    - Install the **PlatformIO IDE** extension from within VS Code.
2.  **Open Project:**
    - Clone this repository.
    - Open the project folder in VS Code (`File > Open Folder...`).
    - PlatformIO will automatically install all required dependencies.

### Step 5: Gas Sensor Calibration (Mandatory!)

Gas sensors will not be accurate without calibration.

1.  **Warm-up (Burn-in):** After assembling and uploading the code, let the device run for **15-30 minutes** for the gas sensors to stabilize.
2.  **Observe Normal Values:** Open the **Serial Monitor** in PlatformIO (Baud Rate: `115200`). In clean air, note the average values for `LPG (MQ-6)` and `Smoke (MQ-2)`. They might be around 1500.
3.  **Set Thresholds:** Open the `src/main.cpp` file and change the `LPG_THRESHOLD` and `SMOKE_THRESHOLD` values to be higher than the normal values (e.g., normal value + 500).
4.  **Re-upload:** Save and upload the code again.

### Step 5: Usage and Monitoring

1.  **Upload Code:** Click the **Upload (‚Üí)** icon in the PlatformIO status bar.
2.  **Monitor System:** Click the **Serial Monitor (üîå)** icon to see the real-time system log.
3.  **Understanding the Pump Logs:**
    - `IDLE`: System is normal, waiting for a request.
    - `WAITING FOR WATER`: The tank is requesting water, but the main pipe is empty. The intermittent alarm will be active.
    - `TESTING`: Water is present in the pipe; the pump is running a flow verification test.
    - `RUNNING`: The test was successful; the pump is running normally. The flow rate will be displayed.
    - `LOCKED OUT`: The test failed (pump might be jammed/flow is too weak); the pump is shut down for 15 minutes.

## üí° Potential Enhancements

- **IoT Connectivity:** Add notifications to Telegram or MQTT for alarms or pump failures.
- **Local Display:** Integrate an OLED screen to display status without needing a computer.
- **Data Logging:** Store event history to an SD card or internal memory.
